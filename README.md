# Cargo Transport Sim
Cargo Transport Simulator is a game in which you run your own Cargo Logistics company. Start out as a simple lonewolf business owner and work your way up to compete with the best in the logistics industry.

Inspired by Euro Truck Simulator.

## Goals
The goals for this project is to make a true-to-life text-based Logistics Simulator in C++. No libraries, and must support old devices (Old Pentiums and AMD Cpu's).

Anyone is welcome to pull and contribute to the project. The most I'm willing to go with Libraries is ncurses as it helps make the console look more appealing.
